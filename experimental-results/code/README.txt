This directory contains programs to generate SAT benchmarks and to
process the data generated by the solvers

Generators:
    
    chess.py
	Generate variations on the mutilated chessboard problem,
	including over boards, cylinders, and torii.

    pigeon-sinz.py
	Generates pigeonhole problems based on an encoding of
	at-most-one constraints due to Carsten Sinz

    pigeon-cook.py
	Generates proofs of the pigeonhole problems using a
	construction formulated by Stephen Cook.  Can also be used to
	generate CNF files of the pigeonhole problem using a direct
	encoding of the at-most-one constraints.

    writer.py
	Auxilliary functions for the generators

Processors:

    randomizer.py
        Generates a random permutation of the input variables for a
        CNF file.  Used to test the effect of randomized input
        orderings on SAT solvers.

    grab_clauses.py
	Extract data from data files generated by PGBDD or PGPBS

    grab_clauses_cdcl.py
    	Extract data from data files generated by KISSAT
